            Blueye aims to make underwater exploration possible for everyone
            with user-friendly and supreme underwater drones that let you
            discover and learn about the world hidden below the surface. The
            PioneerOne drone was designed and realized in 3 months as a
            prototype to exemplify Blueyes capabilities and vision.

          <h2>Like a rollator, but cooler</h2>
          <p>
            Getting senior citizens to stay active is just as challenging in
            Stavanger as in many other parts of the world. To solve this problem
            the municipality chose to use the new public procurement method in
            Norway, Innovation Partnership, to find a solution. The medical aid
            provider, Topro, won the contract. Then together with EGGS as the
            design partner, set about developing a smart rollator to help
            encourage the elderly to be physically more mobile.
