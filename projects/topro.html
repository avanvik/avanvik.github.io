          Getting senior citizens to stay active is just as challenging in Stavanger as in many other parts of the
          world. To solve this problem the municipality chose to use the new public procurement method in Norway,
          Innovation Partnership, to find a solution. The medical aid provider, Topro, won the contract. Then together
          with EGGS as the design partner, set about developing a smart rollator to help encourage the elderly to be
          physically more mobile.
